# CNN Receptive Fields
Receptive field computation for any CNN in PyTorch.

The *receptive field* of a neuron is defined as the region of the input that can change the output of such a neuron. 

The contribution to the value of neuron `n` of pixel `(i, j)` in an input image `x` is computed by 
- setting all the weights in the network to constant values
- replacing Max-Pooling by Average Pooling
- switching off batch norm
- switching on pixels in the input one at a time to check responding neurons. 
- contributions are then rescaled to be in [0, 1]

The resulting receptive fields are a set of images `R^l = [R_n^l | n is a neuron in layer l]` that have the same size of the input. 

The value of `R^l_n[i, j] \in [0, 1]` corresponds to how much pixel `(i, j)`, in an input image - i.e. `x[:, i, j]` - would contribute to the output of neuron `n`, which lives in layer `l`, if the network had constant weights.
